The OX-CPP-SDK is a set of software libraries and tools to support the integration of the OX into third party applications. 
The SDK is based on the C++ Library “libOXApi.so which can be easily integrated into own C++ programs. 

The OX C++ SDK consists of the following parts:
- A C++ shared library (libOXApi.so) which provides access to all OX configuration and measurement possibilities.
- The C++ Header files to use the library.
- A example in C++ which demonstrate the OXApi usage.

Folder structure:
/usr/lib/libOXApi.so              The OX C++ SDK main shared library.
/usr/include                      The OX C++ SDK header files.
/example             	          A C++ cmake example which demonstrates the usage of the OXApi.

Notes:

OXApi:
	- libOXApi.so requires Ubuntu 18.04 LTS with Boost 1.70
	- Only one configuration connection can be established at one time, so if the Webinterface is active, the OXApi will not be able to connect.

UDP Streaming:
	- To use UDP Streaming, the desired streams should be activated by the OXApi or the Webinterface.
	- Ensure that the streaming target IP-Address is configured correctly.
	- If more than one OX should stream to the same computer, different ports should be used.
	- Keep in mind that the firewall may block an application from opening an UDP port.

Setup Development System:
    - Get Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (AMD64 desktop image) from https://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/
       Note: If you only get a black screen while installation, press ESC while Grub menu and then F6 and mark "nomodeset". The start install.
    - Setup Network to get access to the internet
    - Run following command in terminal:
       sudo apt update
       sudo apt install build-essential cmake
    - Install / Upgrade libboost 1.70
       sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mhier/libboost-latest
       sudo apt update
       sudo apt install libboost1.70-dev

Use SDK example:
    - The SDK files are copied to ~/OxApi/
    - Create build directory and run build
       mkdir ~/OxApi/build
       cd ~/OxApi/build
       cmake ../example
       cmake --build .
    - Run example
       ./oxapiexamples
